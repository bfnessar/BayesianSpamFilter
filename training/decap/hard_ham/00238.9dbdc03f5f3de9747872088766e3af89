3. iSiloX 3.25 for Windows and Mac OS enters beta1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
iSiloX 3.25b1 addresses the following issues from iSiloX 3.2:

- Maximum width and height settings for images would not be applied
  to images referenced by an image tag with a width or height
  attribute specification greater than the native width or height
  of the image.
- Within a block with a non-zero text indent, a line following a
  forced break with the <br> tag with markup at the beginning
  of the line would incorrectly be indented.
- If a parent element specifies a font-size using ems, then the
  child element would incorrectly also inherit the specification
  instead of the computed font-size value.  For example, in the
  case where the parent element specified 2em, the actual computed
  value of the child would be 4em (e.g., 2 * 2em = 4em).
- Upon reopening a .ixl file containing a document entry with the
  receive cookies option on, the option would be reset to off.
- In a .ixl file, if an element is specified but has no content,
  the .ixl file may fail to open.

iSiloX 3.25b1 adds the following features to iSiloX 3.2:

- In the Document properties, added a home page section for specifying
  the document home page number and whether or not to open the
  document on the home page when the document date changes.
- In the Text properties, for preformatted text, added an option
  for specifying whether or not to use a monospace font.
- In the Text properties, for preformatted text, added an option
  for specifying whether to keep all single line breaks, remove all
  single line breaks, or only keep single line breaks if a space or
  tab character follows.

Please note that this is a beta version of the software, and as
such is intended for testing purposes to help eliminate problems
and issues before the release.

Please report any problems or issues you encounter by sending an
email to email@iSilo.com.  When reporting problems, please include
