The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing 

ONCE UPON A TIME a Wolf resolved to disguise his 
appearance in order to secure food 
more easily. Encased in the skin of a sheep, he 
pastured with the flock deceiving the shepherd 
by his costume. In the evening he was shut up by 
the shepherd in the fold; the gate was closed, 
and the entrance made thoroughly secure. But the 
shepherd, returning to the fold during the night 
to obtain meat for the next day, mistakenly 
caught up the Wolf instead of a sheep, and 
killed him instantly. 
Harm seek. harm find.
