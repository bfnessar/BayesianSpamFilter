Subject: [GHSclassof1977] Boneheads

Hi Everyone,
There seem to be several "boneheads" in our class. A few months ago I 
ran into John Dahill, he asked me if I would go to the reunion picnic 
with him. His girlfriend and my guyfriend wouldn't know anyone there, 
so I said yes. Yesterday he told me he can't go!! All this time he 
thought it was on Saturday!! Oh well, I will see everyone there 
sometime through the afternoon.
