Think about it!
Just as you have a web designer to build your site and a company to host your site,does it not make sense to use a company that specializes in professionally submitting your web site. 
Getting your web site FOUND and SEEN!


 A Shocking Fact!
Your web site designer and your host are NOT responsible for getting your web site seen!  Yes, they may submit your site to a few search engines periodically but to stay on the TOP of the search engines is an aggressive business.

Getting onto the search engines and at the top of their listings doesn't  just happen.

You have to be put there!

What the.Net, The Internet Magazine 8/2000 said:
"You have your web site designed and have sorted out the maintenance and waiting for the business to roll in, but there's one small problem.... No one knows!"

You need a professional company to do it!

Your Money Back
Guarantee! 
If you do not receive confirmation from the search engines that we submit your web site to, we will give you your money back! Guaranteed!

There is nothing to lose!

Web Site Facts
Remember "The Yellow Pages" Rule! 
 A search engine is like an enormous "yellow pages" with thousands of companies advertising the same product.  Unless you are near the front of the listing your chances of a customer actually seeing you is remote.  Unlike a literal yellow pages there is a way to move YOU to the front and also get you on all of the "Yellow pages" in the world.

What does it take to be seen on the 
Search Engines?

Appreciate the Three Golden Rules
q Search engines do not pull up the web sites at random they use a specific method of search. Those that know them are the ones at the top, those that do not are buried at the bottom! 
q Your web site must be submitted to the search engines every month otherwise your site gets pushed off (Its a bit like a Ferris wheel, you get on and then after a while you are taken off unless you get another ticket and get back on).
q Understand the importance of Keywords, Meta tags, and Titles employed when submitting your site to the search engines! 
Use the right ones and you go up.
Get it wrong and you go to the bottom!
Some feel that it is enough to be on the large search engines. 
Wrong! The problem is because of their sheer size most web sites get buried.  Having your web site professionally submitted can boost you up the listings of these larger search engines, so you can be found on them.  Also many people use the smaller search engines and if your site is professionally submitted your chances of getting to the top are greatly increased. 

It is essential to be on them!

Having Regal Telecom expertly submit your web site every month to worlds search engines will give YOU the Advantage you need. 
 This can make the difference between new customers 
FINDING your web site or NOT!
