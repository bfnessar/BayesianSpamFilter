Subject: Red Hat 8.0

Hi,

Red Hat 8.0 is released tomorrow (monday).  I took some time out to make 
RPMs of GStreamer for it.

All of them (core, plugins and player) have been uploaded to the apt 
repository in a new "redhat-80-i386" directory.

The repository for dependencies is again called "deps", and the one for 
the gstreamer rpms is "redhat", because this time around the base distro 
contains all the necessary packages.

A screenshot of Red Hat 8.0 running gst-player is up at
http://thomas.apestaart.org/download/screenshots/redhat-80-gst-player.png


Here are some known issues with the resulting rpms :

a) gstreamer-nautilus isn't built, the package got renamed and I don't 
have a -devel package for it yet

b) the c++ plugins have problems which I haven't been able to resolve.
Here are the errors:

INFO (15299: 0)gst_xml_registry_rebuild:1555: Plugin 
/usr/lib/gst/libgstwincodec.so failed to load: Error loading plugin 
/usr/lib/gst/libgstwincodec.so, reason: /usr/lib/libaviplay-0.7.so.0: 
undefined symbol: _ZTVN10__cxxabiv120__si_class_type_infoE

Plugin /usr/lib/gst/libgstwincodec.so failed to load
DEBUG(15299: 0)gst_plugin_load_plugin:161: attempt to load plugin 
"/usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so"
INFO (15299: 0)gst_xml_registry_rebuild:1555: Plugin

/usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so, reason: /usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so: 
undefined symbol: __gxx_personality_v0

I'm not sure how to fix this; running strings on the libs in /usr/lib 
reveals that there are other libs that have these symbols, so there must 
be something straightforward that should fix this.
If anyone has a suggestion, please share ;)

Thomas
