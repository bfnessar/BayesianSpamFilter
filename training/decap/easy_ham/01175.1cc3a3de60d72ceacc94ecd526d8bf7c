Subject: From


When I receive a message that has a line starting with "From ", it's
broken into two messages.  I get my mail from /var/spool/mail.  The
program that incorporates mail thinks that the "From " line starts a new
message.

My sysadmins have told me that the sending mail client is supposed to 
escape lines begining with "From ".  EXMH (2.5) doesn't do this.  Should 
it?  It appears that my MH is MH 6.8.  Does NMH fix this?
