A new census of the world's robot population reveals disturbing negative robot 
population growth, but still, our fleshless offspring's numbers point to a 
machinery future: 

    Some 20,000 domestic-help robots were sold worldwide last year, half 
    designed to mow lawns. Vacuum-cleaning robots were introduced late in 2001 
    and a study in Sweden found that 5,000 were sold in the last two months of 
    the year. Window-cleaning robots are set to boom, said the U.N. study.
