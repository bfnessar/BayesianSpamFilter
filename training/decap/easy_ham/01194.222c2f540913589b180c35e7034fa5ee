Hm, it is built inside the same chroot.  aviplay works (well it would if I 
had XV, I get X errors ;)).  But it doesn't complain about linker 
problems.  So I suppose my avifile library on itself is compiled ok.

Sigh, avifile is one of the worst packages out there, in all aspects - 
naming of tarballs, not ever releasing an actual package, versioning of 
libraries, API stability, ...
