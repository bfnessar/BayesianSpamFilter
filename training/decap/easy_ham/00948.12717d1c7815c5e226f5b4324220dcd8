I'm not seeing a hit on 'next'. A quick "just pound on 'next' and watch the
wall clock" test shows me able to go through 20 messages in under 5 seconds,
so it's well under 250ms per switch, but I'm seeing a really piggy CPU spike
(100% for a few seconds) in the 'flist' code.  Of course, it seems to be
related to number-of-folders:

[~] wc Mail/.folders
    131     131    1122 Mail/.folders

It's particularly annoying because things just hose-and-hang for 10 seconds, so
when it hits, you have a long latency before what you're doing actually
happens...

14:08:54 Background_DoPeriodic flist
14:08:54 Flist_FindSeqs reset=0
14:08:54 FlistFindStart reset=0 active=0
14:08:56 Reading /home/valdis/Mail/exmh/.mh_sequences
14:08:56 exmh has 1 msgs in unseen
14:08:56 1 unseen message in 1 folder
14:08:56 {In FlagInner up iconup labelup}
14:08:56 {Setting flag glyph to iconup}
14:08:56 {Set flag state to up}
14:08:58 Reading /home/valdis/Mail/list-spams/.mh_sequences
14:08:58 list-spams has 1 msgs in unseen
14:08:58 2 unseen messages in 2 folders
14:08:58 {In FlagInner up iconup labelup}
14:09:02 Reading /home/valdis/Mail/trash/.mh_sequences
14:09:02 trash has 2 msgs in pseq
14:09:03 /home/valdis/Mail/xemacs/7508 not found
14:09:03 /home/valdis/Mail/xemacs/7507 not found
14:09:03 /home/valdis/Mail/xemacs/7508 not found
14:09:03 /home/valdis/Mail/xemacs/7507 not found
14:09:03 {pseq: 7506-7508 => 7506}
14:09:03 Writing /home/valdis/Mail/xemacs/.mh_sequences
14:09:03 xemacs has 1 msgs in pseq
14:09:03 Flist_Done

And it takes a hit even if there's no new mail:

14:11:03 Background_DoPeriodic flist
14:11:03 Flist_FindSeqs reset=0
14:11:03 FlistFindStart reset=0 active=0
14:11:12 Flist_Done
14:11:12 Flist_FindSeqs end {9018315 microseconds per iteration}

I'm perfectly willing to can-opener that code and see where the CPU is
going, but only if nobody is slapping their forehead and mumbling about
a brown-paper-bag bug... ;)
