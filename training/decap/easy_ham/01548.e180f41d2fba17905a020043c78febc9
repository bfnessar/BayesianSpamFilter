Does this fork+exec a perl interpreter for every incoming mail? If so, I 
reckon your mailer is vulerable to a DoS attack without too much effort...
The real question is: is there a way to run razor without this overhead?  
Even some sort of razord you could talk to over a unix socket would do.
Until I can find one, I cannot spare the resources to run razor at all :(
