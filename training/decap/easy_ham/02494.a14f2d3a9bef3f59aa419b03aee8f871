"Like everyone else, I had become a
slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.
If I saw something like clever coffee
table sin the shape of a yin and yang,
I had to have it. I would flip through
catalogs and wonder, "What kind of dining
set defines me as a person?" We used to
read pornography. Now it was the Horchow
Collection. I had it all. Even the glass
dishes with tiny bubbles and imperfections,
proof they were crafted by the honest,
simple, hard-working indigenous peoples of
wherever."
 - Jack, Fight Club 


In Fight Club, Tyler Durden destroys this nesting instinct by *bombing* 
Jack's apartment. Hmmmm. 


Where you going with this, Ikea boy?
