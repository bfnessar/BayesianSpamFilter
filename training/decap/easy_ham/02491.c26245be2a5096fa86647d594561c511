Subject: [ILUG] dual keyboards

Hi all.
Does anyone know how to set up dual keyboards(one is actually a stand-alone
keypad)?
Both keyboards have PS/2 connections and I want the keypad to be plugged in
as the primary input device.  Then if the other keyboard is plugged in, that
should take over.
Possible?  Any possible hacks?
Thanks!
Carlos
