Writing an IMAP server is a non-trivial task.  The specification is huge
and clients do all kinds of weird stuff.  POP is very easy in
comparison.  Perhaps you could forward messages to a special address or
save them in a special folder to mark them as false negatives.

Alternatively, perhaps there could be a separate protocol and client
that could be used to review additions to the training set.  Each day a
few random spam and ham messages could be grabbed as candidates.
Someone would periodically startup the client, review the candidates,
reclassify or remove any messages they don't like and add them to the
training set.
