Here are the new scores in the 2.40 branch (they may change, but they
are better than before).

score INVALID_MSGID                  1.226
score MSG_ID_ADDED_BY_MTA            1.696
score MSG_ID_ADDED_BY_MTA_2          0.532

Total of 3.5 which is better than 7.4, I suppose.

If they fixed their MSGID, it would help.  I suppose we could allow
comments without hurting spam detection too much, but I'm reluctant
(it's pretty bizarre to put a comment after the Message-ID header).

Can you open a bugzilla ticket for this one?
