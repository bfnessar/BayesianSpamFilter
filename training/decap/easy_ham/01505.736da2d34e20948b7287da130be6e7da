Subject: [SAtalk] Razor problem

I just picked up Razor SDK 2.03 and  2.14 agents from the the razor site.
I am using SuSe 7.3 - intalled SDK with no problems. All tests passed.

When I try to make the 2.14 agents I get all kinds of errors. In
particuliar it says the net::dns is missing. But it seems to be there. The
SDK test passes it.

Any help would be appreciated.

Doug
