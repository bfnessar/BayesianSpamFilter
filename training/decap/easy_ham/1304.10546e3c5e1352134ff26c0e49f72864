Well, I don't really find it consistent at all to use an rpm package built
against something that wasn't installed through rpm :-/

What I'd recommend in your case : You should keep at least one original Red
Hat Linux kernel (you do just in case, right? ;-)) and install the matching
alsa-kernel package as you'll need at least one because of the
dependencies. Then for your custom built kernel, simply "./configure
--with-cards=all && make && make install DESTDIR=/tmp/alsa-driver" from the
alsa-driver sources then as root copy all the modules under
/tmp/alsa-driver/lib/modules/ to your modules dir and run "depmod -a".

Of course you can even make it much faster by not compiling all un-needed
drivers, as I guess that's one of the reasons one would rebuild his own
kernel.

I find this the easiest and cleanest way to get around the problem. It's
what I've done and what I'll keep doing on my laptop where I'm running a
kernel recompiled with ACPI.
