I don't care if the mail is foldered on python.org, but personal
messages regardless of who they're for, shouldn't be part of the
public spambayes repository unless specifically approved by both the
recipient and sender.

Note also that we are much more liberal about python.org/zope.org
mailing list traffic than most folks.  Read list-managers for any
length of time and you'll find that there are a lot of people who
assert strict copyright over their collections, are very protective of
their traffic, and got really pissed when gmane just started
gatewaying their messages without asking.

Which might be an appropriate for their lists, but not for ours (don't
think I'm suggesting we do the same -- I /like/ our laissez-faire
approach).

But for personal email, we should be more careful.
