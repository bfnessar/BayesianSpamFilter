Subject: creating rpms with subdirs (install command)

Hi, I'm building an rpm for the resin webserver, and I basically want to 
install the entire tarball under a diretory, but, the tarball includes 
subdirectorys, in my spec i have:


install -s -m 755 %{name}-%{version}.%{release}/* \
  $RPM_BUILD_ROOT/usr/local/resin

and I'm getting:

install: `resin-2.0.5/bin' is a directory
install: `resin-2.0.5/conf' is a directory

Is there a proper/nice way I should handle this?
