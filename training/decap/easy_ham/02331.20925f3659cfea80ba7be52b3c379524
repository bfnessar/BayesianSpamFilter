Disney's themepark business is in deep trouble in the post-9/11 world. A war 
with Iraq could really kill 'em: 

    While aggressively adding attractions, Disney boosted its profit by 
    steadily raising admission prices. The strategy worked, helping deliver 
    record profit for Disney year after year. 

    "The strategy was build, build, build. Every year there was something new," 
    said David Koenig, a Disney historian and author. "It was an astounding 
    growth period.... Now they're overexposed."... 

    Theme park operating income for Disney this year is expected to fall 27% to 
    $1.16 billion, said Prudential Securities analyst Katherine Styponias. By 
    2003, she said, the business could climb to $1.49 billion, depending on 
    whether the U.S. goes to war with Iraq.
