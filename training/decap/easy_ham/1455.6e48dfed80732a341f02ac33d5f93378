Subject: [SAtalk] Tru64 compile of SA

I'm a new user (or about to be, hopefully) of SA but I've run into some
compilation errors that prevent me from installing.  Rather than picking
through the code, I thought I'd avoid reinventing the wheel and ask here.
When I run the 'make', I get the following:

cc: Error: spamd/spamc.c, line 50: In this declaration, "in_addr_t" has no
linka
ge and has a prior declaration in this scope at line number 572 in file
/usr/inc
lude/sys/types.h. (nolinkage)
typedef unsigned long   in_addr_t;      /* base type for internet address
*/
------------------------^
cc: Warning: spamd/spamc.c, line 169: In this statement, the referenced
type of
the pointer value "msg_buf" is "char", which is not compatible with
"unsigned ch
ar". (ptrmismatch)
  if((bytes = full_read (in, msg_buf, max_size+1024, max_size+1024)) >
max_size)
-----------------------------^
cc: Warning: spamd/spamc.c, line 174: In this statement, the referenced
type of
the pointer value "header_buf" is "char", which is not compatible with
"const un
signed char". (ptrmismatch)
    full_write (out,header_buf,bytes2);
--------------------^

There are lots more where they came from.  Any ideas what can be done?
Thanks in advance.
