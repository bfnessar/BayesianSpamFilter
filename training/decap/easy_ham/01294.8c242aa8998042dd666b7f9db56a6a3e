If anyone here is running (null) beta then you may like these Gnome theme packages.
They are enhanced and repackages from my previous theme packs, this time to conform
to the way pre-release RH8 handles themes for GTK1 and GTK2.

RedHat has a preferences -> themes app, but themes only show up there that have BOTH
gtk1.2 (Gnome1) themes AND gtk1.4 (GTK2 aka Gnome2) themes available. Then RH will
apply the theme to both GTK versions, so the user does not really notice that
different GTK toolkit versions are being used, since they *should* look the same.

This "gtk2-engines-compat" RPM has GTK2 ported themes for those themes that are
included in the RH package "gtk-engines" themes pack for GTK1.

The "gtk1+2-themez" pack mostly repackages my previous theme RPMs in a way that the
(null) btea like, and supposedly the next RH8 when released :)
