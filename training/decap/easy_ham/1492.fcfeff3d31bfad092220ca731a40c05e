Subject: RE: [Razor-users] honor is not in csl

I know that I did this during the week that all the catalogue's were
hokey but after that I changed it back to discovery.  So I can see why
people are using honor.

Folks, 

Some of you seem to have hardcoded honor as the default catalogue
server. There are three catalogue only servers running now, and honor is
acting as a nomination only server. Tonight we will be completely
turning off catalogue support on honor, so if you are specifying honor
with the -rs option, please take it out and let the agents discover a
closeby catalogue server.

cheers,
vipul.
