Subject: [Razor-users] How to test razor

I have a spamd/spamc/razor/dcc setup.

My razor logs are full of:

Sep 10 09:48:48.411339 check[10200]: [ 1] [bootup] Logging initiated 
LogDebugLevel=3 to file:/home/omega13/.razor/razor-agent.log
Sep 10 09:48:49.391309 check[10200]: [ 3] mail 1 is not known spam.

The problem is that all the entries show "is not known spam"  I can't believe 
I'm that lucky.  So, how do I test to see that my razor installation is 
working properly.  I've been up to my ears in documentation for the past few 
days, so, if the reference is easy, just point me to it.  Otherwise a brief 
hint on how to, would be appreciated.
