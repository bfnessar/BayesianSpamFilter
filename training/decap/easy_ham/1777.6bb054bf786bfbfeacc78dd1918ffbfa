That shrinks to under 2 million bytes, though, if I delete all the WordInfo
records with spamprob exactly equal to UNKNOWN_SPAMPROB.  Such records
aren't needed when scoring (an unknown word gets a made-up probability of
UNKNOWN_SPAMPROB).  Such records are only needed for training; I've noted
before that a scoring-only database can be leaner.

In part the bloat is due to character 5-gram'ing, part due to that the
database is brand new so has never been cleaned via clearjunk(), and part
due to plain evil gremlins.
