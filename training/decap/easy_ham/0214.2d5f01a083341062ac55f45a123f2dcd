I'm surprised to not find this phenomenon in Corlis. I could have sworn I
saw it there. He does have the somewhat similar dark sky between a rainbow
and a secondary bow. I personally have seen a rainbow enclosing a
semi-circle of darker sky.

I know I've read about pillars under the Sun and Moon elsewhere, but I can't
recall if they were reportedly dark or bright. I do know these sorts of
things are supposed to be quirks of optics not of the visual system. I'm
sorry I haven't got any answers, but a search through some books on
atmospheric optics ought to turn a few hints up.
