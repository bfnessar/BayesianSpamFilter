As I understand it, there is a huge difference between native Americans
who speak english at home and those who do not.  I don't have figures
that separate those at hand, though.

1989 American Indians (US Pop as a whole) -- Families below poverty
27.2% (10%), Persons below poverty 31.2 (13.1), Speak a language other
than English 23 (13.8) Married couple families 65.8 (79.5) Median family
income $21,619 ($35,225) Per Capita $8,284 ($14,420).

Note: High Income countries in 1989 were defined as having over $6,000
per capita.  American Indians separated from the rest of the US society
would still be considered a high-income society.
