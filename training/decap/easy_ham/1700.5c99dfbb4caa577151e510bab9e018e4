Subject: [Razor-users] "Can't use and undefined value.." error

I just installed razor 2.152 on a FreeBSD 4.4-RELEASE box and having
problems with razor-check.  Any time razor-check is run, (with or without
arguments), i get this error:

Can't use an undefined value as a symbol reference at
/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.005/i386-freebsd/Razor2/Client/Agent.pm
line 756.

razor-admin runs just fine and the make test before the install was all
ok.

Has anyone seen this before?
