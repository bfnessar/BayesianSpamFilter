I am using SpamAssassin as part of the MailScanner package (using sendmail
as the MTA). It integrates nicely in there, and shares a configuration file
with SA. All very neat.

I thought that SA rated a message with a certain score, then did a certain
action (such as store | deliver | delete) based on the configuration given.
I was hoping there were some other actions that I could custom-program in.

Again, many thanks,


Adrian
