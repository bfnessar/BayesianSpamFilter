Subject: [Same thread ish] [ILUG] adsl router modem combo

having great fun trying to find a dumb ADSL modem with Ethernet
presentation, everybody wants to sell routers but I intend on doing pppoe
from another device, something with more than one Ethernet port would be
nice.
anybody got any recommendations ?
