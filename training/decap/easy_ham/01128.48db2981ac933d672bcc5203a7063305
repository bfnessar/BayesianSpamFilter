Subject: Re: traceback in new exmh

Oops - turns out i wasn't careful installing it, so the exmh(library)
variable was pointing at my old installation.  I'm surprised it worked
as well as it did.

In any case, I removed the old library directory, and edited exmh,
exmh-bg, exmh-strip, etc to point at the right one.  Now I'm getting
another traceback on startup:

can't read "mhPriv(pubseq,family,cur)": no such variable
    while executing
"MhSeq $folder $seq add $mhPriv(pubseq,$folder,$seq) [MhSeqExpand
$folder $msgids"
    (procedure "MhReadSeqs" line 73)
    invoked from within
"MhReadSeqs $folder seqs"
    (procedure "Mh_Sequences" line 2)
    invoked from within
"Mh_Sequences $folder"
    (procedure "Flist_UnseenUpdate" line 4)
    invoked from within
"Flist_UnseenUpdate $folder"
    (procedure "FolderChange" line 51)
    invoked from within
"FolderChange family {Msg_Show cur}"
    invoked from within
"time [list  FolderChange $folder $msgShowProc"
    (procedure "Folder_Change" line 3)
    invoked from within
"Folder_Change $exmh(folder)"
    (procedure "Exmh" line 101)
    invoked from within
"Exmh"
    ("after" script)


+family is the folder I was in when I quit exmh.

I'm on a remote display right now, and its really slow.  I'll have to
play with it more tonight when I get home to see if there are any
other problems.
