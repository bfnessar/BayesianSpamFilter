Subject: [ILUG] Sun Solaris..

Can someone explain what type of operating system Solaris is... as ive never
seen or used it i dont know wheather to get a server from Sun or from DELL i
would prefer a linux based server and Sun seems to be the one for that but
im not sure if Solaris is a distro of linux or a completely different
operating system? can someone explain...
