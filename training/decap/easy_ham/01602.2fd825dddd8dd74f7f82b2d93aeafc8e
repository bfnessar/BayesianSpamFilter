Subject: [Razor-users] Fire.cloudmark.com is having issues

I noticed a drop in checks, and did some tests.  If I move truth up in
my catalog list, a check comes back postive, but if I move fire up in
the list, then I don't get the positive check back.  It's almost like
it's not syncing up with Hubris which is the one my reports are getting
sent to.
