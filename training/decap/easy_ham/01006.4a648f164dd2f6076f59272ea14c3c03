Subject: bad focus/click behaviours


I am a (tv)twm user. when I snarf text into my mouse cut buffer, and then
attempt to inject it into the exmh input windows for comp/repl, the 'point'
is often an apparently random place in the text pane, not where I think I
have current flashing cursor. 

I usually wipe out any of To:/Subject:/<random body> with the text. Its
often not even beginning of line denoted, ie its an unexplicable number
of char spaces in to the text where it inserts, 

What am I doing wrong in either X, WM, shell, EXMH which is causing this?

cheers
