The British government has invited the local equivalent of the RIAA to fund an 
"anti-piracy" post. As Charlie puts it, "Mr Fox, here's the new set of 
hen-house keys you ordered." 

    The UK music industry is to co-fund a new post at the Department for 
    Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) to act as a link with the government in the 
    struggle with music piracy.
