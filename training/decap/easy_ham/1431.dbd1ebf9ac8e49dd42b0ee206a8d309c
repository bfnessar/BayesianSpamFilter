 If you think you can survive it, please fight... When I found that patent I
found others that were just common sense, things that any geek could implement
with his script/shell-language of choice; and it's time for someone to get the
medias attention on what's going on.
 Basically this is the new wave of "namenappers"; it used to be domainnames,
not it's all the basic general ideas they can think off/find on the web that
they're patenting.
