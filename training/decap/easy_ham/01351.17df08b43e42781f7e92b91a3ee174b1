Subject: [SAtalk] Compile error under Digital Unix

Hi, I'm trying to build SA under Digital Unix 4.0f and am receiving a
compile error (and many warnings) for spamc.  The "perl Makefile.PL"
does OK, but when I do the make, I get this:

cc -std -fprm d -ieee -D_INTRINSICS -I/usr/local/include -DLANGUAGE_C
-O4 spamd
/spamc.c  -o spamd/spamc -L/usr/local/lib -lbind -ldbm -ldb -lm -liconv
-lutil

Can anyone suggest a way to get around this?   TIA...
