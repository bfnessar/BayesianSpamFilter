Subject: RE: Java is for kiddies

With the increasing prevalence of web services (not that they are always a
good thing), I doubt that parsing XML will be something that will remain at
the Java application layer for long... Recent threads here on Fork
indicating the move towards hardware parsing or this code even become part
of the native implementation of Java on various platforms...

Yea, and that on top of the 100x of all the parsing engines over just
bigendian'ing it and passing the data (5x+++) in the raw. Then it REALLY
matters.
