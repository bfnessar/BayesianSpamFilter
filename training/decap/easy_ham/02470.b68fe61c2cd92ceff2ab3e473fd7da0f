Subject: [ILUG-Social] spam...

ok, if an email address is not in my whitelist, they are asked to confirm.
in that message there is the following text:

    If your message was an unsolicited message attempting to sell
    Kevin some product or advertise one scam or another, then DO NOT
    reply to this message.  If you do reply and he has some free time
    on his hands, He'll find out who and where you are and send you his
    review of your email and an invoice for EUR 1,000 for his services.
    Plus he'll probably try to patch me in some unpleasant way so *please*
    don't reply if you're one of those people.

in addition, all of this information is logged.  in the past two to three
months, two spammers have replied.  i think that this is a valid notice.
what i'm wondering is the following:

    a)  are there debt collection agencies you can hire to get such debts?
    b)  if i can't get money from them, can i declare them on my taxes
	here as a bad debt and get tax relief?

one way to get the gov't to notice spam...
