The procmail bug happens when the filter program does something that 
procmail doesn't expect.  Exactly what that something is, hasn't been
confirmed by anyone on the procmail list.  It might be exiting with a
nonzero status, or it might be producing output on the standard error,
or it might be something else entirely.

So Simon is attempting to get SA to run flawlessly, because then it can't
tickle the procmail bug.  This isn't a fix, it's a band-aid, but because
he apparently doesn't have the option of installing a newer procmail ...
