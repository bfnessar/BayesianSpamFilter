[roi@roi roi]$ rpm -qa | grep -i sdl
SDL_image-devel-1.2.2-3
xmame-SDL-0.60.1-fr2
SDL_mixer-1.2.4-5
SDL-1.2.4-5
SDL-devel-1.2.4-5
SDL_mixer-devel-1.2.4-5
SDL_net-1.2.4-3
SDL_net-devel-1.2.4-3
SDL_image-1.2.2-3

Seems I got all packages I need.
It worked on redhat 7.3 I did upgrade not reinstall so packages
shouldn't make a problem.
