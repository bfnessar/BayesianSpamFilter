Most spammers don't check reply codes at all, they just send out as many
mails as their system will hold without checking for any confirmation.

A trick to lower spam reception was dicussed on the postfix mailing list

it is offered the first time, and accept it the second time. Apparently most
mass-emailers don't even try to deliver a second time.
