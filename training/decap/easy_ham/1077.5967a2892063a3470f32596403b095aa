I run exmh routinely from home (broadband) using an XWindows Client tunneled through ssh under <ahem> WinXP.  It works very well in this fashion.

FWIW, I use Eudora under Winder$ because it's less of a virus magnet.  :)

There's more to the story why I run Winder$, but that's really off-topic and I'm already guilty!
