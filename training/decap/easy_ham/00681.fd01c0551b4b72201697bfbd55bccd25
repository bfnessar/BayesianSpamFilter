Subject: AmeriCorpsVISTA

The pay's not good (9,300 a year), but there is insurance, a 4,700 (I 
think) off a student loan, or for future education, and non-compete status 
for any govt. job after a year's service.  I moved to New Orleans 
yesterday, and I should be flying to DC in about a month to start the 
AmeriCorps training.  I'll be setting up a community technology center which 
will be used to teach computer literacy skills to low income folks (just, 
like, learning MS shit (yeah yeah, wtf am i doing?  I know.))  so that 
they can possibly find better jobs.  I'm sure I'll be doing all sorts 
of other things too, like helping folks with their taxes, writing grants, 
etc.  The website is www.americorps.org.  There are -all- sorts of jobs 
all over the country, so if someone out there can survive on the small 
salary, it's something s/he might want to take a look at.  

Since Xi is in college and getting grants + scholarship + child support 
from dad, my load has gone down terrifically.  The IRS is after me for 
money I didn't make on the stock market, so it's a way to at least get 
into a situation where they will have to understand that yes, they will 
have to wait.  

But bottom line benefit and motivation is the feelgood that ya get when 
you do this type of job.  I'm up for some of that.
