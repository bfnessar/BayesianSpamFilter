Don't worry about the warnings. To fix the error, edit spamc.c and right 
after the line that says:

#define EX__MAX 77

Add:

#if !defined __osf__
extern char *optarg;
typedef unsigned long   in_addr_t;      /* base type for internet address */
#endif

(you're adding the two lines that start with #).
