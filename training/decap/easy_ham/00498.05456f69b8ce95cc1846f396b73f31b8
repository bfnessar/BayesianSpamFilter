It is not uncommon to find gay males who had sex with several thousands
partners (there would be more, in fact lots more, probably, but a lot of
them have died). Don't have to be a callboy, if considering that you can
have intercourse with several partners in a single day in a bathouse it
doesn't look particularly difficult to do.

Clearly this is not something what hets do, prostitution not taken into
account.
