Subject: Patch to complete a change...

I suspect that as part of Chris' set of changes, he cleaned up the
use of the variable that was named "L" in FtocCommit (in ftoc.tcl).
Its name got changed from L to lineno

But there's one reference of $L left.   That causes tracebacks if
you attempt to use "link" with the current CVS version of exmh.

I guess that most of us don't use "link" very often ... I noticed it
last week, but only got time to look and see why today.

If someone with the ability to commit to the CVS repository would
apply the following patch (to lib/ftoc.tcl) that would be nice.
(It works... and is trivial, and you could perhaps just apply it by
making the change with an editor faster than saving this patch and
applying it - there's only one instance of $L in the file, that
should be changed to $lineno)
