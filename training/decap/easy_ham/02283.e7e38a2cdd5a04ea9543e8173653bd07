Neil "Sandman" Gaiman has won his lawsuit against Todd "Spawn" McFarlane, 
vindicated in his assertion that McFarlane breached his contracts, stole his 
characters, and used his name. 

    McFarlane looked down somberly as the verdict was read. As the judge polled 
    the individual jury members, he looked at their faces.
