Subject: [SAtalk] Thought for RPM/deb/etc packagers

BTW, I've been thinking a little about the RPMs and other packages.
Already the PLD guys are distributing 3 rpms:

  - perl-Mail-SpamAssassin

          the perl modules.

  - spamassassin

          the "spamassassin" and "spamd" scripts,
          spamd rc-file etc.

  - spamassassin-tools

          mass-check, masses directory stuff, etc.
          for generating rescore data from corpora.

This seems like a good way to do it; this way, stuff which just needs
the perl modules doesn't need to require the full RPM be installed,
with RC files in init.d etc.

It's been adopted in the distributed .spec file, anyway.

Theo, BTW, what's the eval test you add in the tvd version of the RPM?

--j.
