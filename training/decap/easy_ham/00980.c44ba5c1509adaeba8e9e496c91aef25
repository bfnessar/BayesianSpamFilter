Wanting to sort like that is not common; I'd be surprised if exmh has
a widget for it.  You can achieve what you want with the command-line
mh tools, though.
I suggest doing the following from a shell prompt:

 sh -c 'for f in "`folders -recurse -fast`" ; do sortm +"$f" ; done'

(The command "sortm" will sort a particular folder, and
"folders -recurse -fast" prints out a list of all of your folders.)


I hope this helps,
