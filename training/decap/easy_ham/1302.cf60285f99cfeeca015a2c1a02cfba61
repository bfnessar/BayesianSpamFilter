I use a mostly Red Hat 8.0 system, but prefer to configure and build my 
kernel by hand.  I'd like to humbly offer a tweak to alsa-driver.spec 
that helps it build cleanly under such circumstances.  I recognize that 
freshrpms.net packages are designed with standard Red Hat in mind, 
including a standard kernel RPM.  However, I hope that Matthias will 
consider the tweak small enough to justify its incorporation.

The diff is attached below.  The first part of the diff contains a 
conditional that checks to see if the expected RPM is installed.  If it 
is, %{karch} is set as before and a new %{krpm} flag is set to 1.  If 
the expected RPM is not installed, then %{karch} is instead set using 
"uname -p", while %{krpm} is left undefined.

The second part of the diff is simpler.  We only require that 
kernel-source be installed if the kernel itself came from an RPM.  (If 
the kernel was hand-built, the presumably the user knows enough to have 
retained the sources in the expected place.)

Again, I realize that I'm operating "off warrantee" by not using a Red 
Hat kernel RPM.  Matthias, if you think this tweak is reasonable and not 
too ugly, I'd love to see you pick it up.  If not, well at least this 
message will sit in the archives and may help other folks in the future.
