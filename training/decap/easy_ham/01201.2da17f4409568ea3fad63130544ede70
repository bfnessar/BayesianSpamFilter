Hmmm... I don't see any :-)

My main concern is that when rebuilding the recent packages I've made for
Psyche on Valhalla, I'd need to lower the "Release:" tag (to keep an
upgrade working), and that would f*ck up my CVS repository which is on my
Valhalla box (well, I'm exagerating, It'll just make it more difficult for
me) ;-)
Sure, there are easy ways around this, but the easiest for me will be to
wait until I upgrade my main box to Psyche and have Valhalla only on a
secondary rebuild system.
