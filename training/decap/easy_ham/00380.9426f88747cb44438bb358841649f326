Subject: SChoolHouseRocks DVD


Of course they had to do this AFTER we purcahsed these all on vhs, and yes
it is now run by the great evil empire known as disney...but we got the
new School House Rocks DVD anyway and man is it an amazing item.

First off , my 8 year old has been singing them since she was 6. Second
off, these are much easier to rip to divx and mp3. Third, new songs,
remastered originals and other dvd goodies. Its a 2 dvd set so its well
worth the 17$ we paid for it.

Even if you dont have kids, run do not walk to pick this one up.

Man, I would sure love to have a *nix Rocks for the kids.
