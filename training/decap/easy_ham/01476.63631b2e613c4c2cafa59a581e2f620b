uh, no, you don't want to make it world-writable.  world-readable.

Just remember that the .razor and whatever DCC uses needs to be
world-readable as well.  The solution is then to make a world-writable
log file for at least Razor.  I like symlinking /dev/null myself.

efficient?  probably (depends on the user base), but it also takes
the control away from the user (which may or may not be a good thing,
depending again on the user base...)
