I would like to use [Link] a lot more, but is it rather
inconvenient.

I have set my right mouse button to [Move] a message to another
folder, which works fine.

However, [Link] also uses the same destination folder as [Move], and
so if I want to use [Link] I first have to mark the destination
folder with a message-move, undo the move, then I can use the
[Link].  Very inconvenient.

Is there a better way for me to set this up so that [Link] works
with one or two simple clicks?

(In essence: is there a way to mark a destination folder for a
message link or move without actually doing a move or link, I
couldn't see anything obvious).

Cheers
Tony
