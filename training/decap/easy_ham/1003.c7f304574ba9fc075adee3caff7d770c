Subject: [SAdev] Body Test Question /d ?

Suppose I created a rule that was in this form:

body RULE_NAME /text to delete/d

Would the "/d" delete this text from the body and mask it from the rest of the 
rules? If so - I'm thinking about applying it to Yahoo and SN and Juno ads so 
that FPs are reduced.
