Yes.

One of the nicer aspects of exmh's colour handling is that while I have
the default background for the message pane set to black, the second
insance of exmh displaying to a given $DISPLAY will set the background
of the message pane to darkslategray.  Very nice as it provides an
instant visual cue as to which is which.  (No: I've not checked where it
gets that colour selection from).
