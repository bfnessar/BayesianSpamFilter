Subject: Energy gamers screwed California economy

Stefan sez: 

    A federal judge has determined that gas pipline manager El Paso did indeed 
    limit natural gas supplies to California, resulting in ruinous prices, 
    rolling blackouts, and smug Cato Institute flaks wagging their fingers at 
    hot-tubbers and environmentalists. 

    California was sitting on a juicy dotcom-era tax windfall before it all got 
    sucked away by this phony crisis. 

    If I were Gov. Davis, I'd sieze every private pipeline, powerline, and 
    power plant and hold them hostage until the energy industry pays back every 
    dime they extorted from the state.
