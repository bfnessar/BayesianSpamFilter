Brothel duty for Australian MP

A conservative Member of Parliament in Australia is set to 
spend the day as a "slave" at one of Western Australia's most 
notorious brothels. 

Liberal Party member Barry Haase was "won" in a charity auction 
after the madam of Langtree's brothel in the mining town of 
Kalgoorlie made the highest offer for his services for a day. 

[...]

"I hope he will leave with an informed decision on what 
Australian brothels are all about and it will help him in his 
political career to make informed decisions that he might not 
have been able to make before," Ms Kenworthy said. 

Mr Haase, a member of Prime Minister John Howard's party 
seemed relaxed about the prospect of working in a brothel. 

"You can't be half-hearted about fundraising for significant 
charities and I think I'm big enough to play the game," he said.
