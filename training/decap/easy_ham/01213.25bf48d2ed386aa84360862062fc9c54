Well, I've made an updated libsigc++ 1.0.4 package. It rebuilds cleanly on
7.3 but the *.so* libraries are missing when trying to rebuild on 8.0 (the
.a and .la files and everything else is though).
Do you have an idea of what the problem may be? Julian : Do you want the
.src.rpm to try to find the cause?
