Which means the sender has a list of who the true
targets are, and who the fake targets are, and
scripts for mixing these. On the receiving side,
my email client distinguishes between messages
that are read, and messages that are not. I like
to mark or save messages that are particularly
interresting or important to me. And even if I
make a point to delete "suspicious material"
immediately upon reading it, even THAT might
leave an interesting kind of trace on my machine.

Sorry, but I don't buy the argument that spam
protects people who want to distribute or see
material the government disapproves.
