The saying, as I recall, is along
the lines of "put your best foot
forward".

(In this case, you seem to have put
everything forward, in a Fosbury
Flop consisting of the best foot,
the worst foot, enough arms for a
diety and his consort, and even a
set of spare limbs from Hoffa or
the space aliens or whatever it is
you keep locked up in the trunk of
the Bonneville)

Pascal could write short letters,
when he had the time.  Is editing
to provide an "executive summary"
really being untrue to yourself?

(We are all used to a full-bore
real-time Rohit streaming, but
that's because we are already
"Friends of", and know to set
our buffers accordingly.  For a
stranger's sake, it may be best
to provide the "elevator pitch
Rohit" -- and negotiate upwards
only after a session has been
established)
