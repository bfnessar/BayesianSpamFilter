You need to install the "glut" package from Red Hat Linux 8.0 (and
"glut-devel" if you intend to recompile the source rpm).

Here you need both "aalib" and "lirc" from freshrpms.net. They're small,
they can be quite useful, that's why I've compiled xine with them as a
default.
You should be able to get rid of those two though, by rebuilding the source
rpm (otherwise it's a bug in my packaging!) :
rpmbuild --rebuild --without aalib --without lirc xine*.src.rpm
