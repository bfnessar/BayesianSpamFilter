VIRGIN'S latest airliner is being revamped after randy passengers
discovered a tiny cabin was just the place to join the Mile High Club.

The £130million Airbus 340-600 is fitted with a 5ft x 4ft mother and
baby room with a plastic table meant for changing nappies.

But couples keep wrecking it by sneaking in for a quick bonk.

Virgin has replaced the table several times even though the plane only
came into service a few weeks ago.

It is named Claudia Nine after sexy model Claudia Schiffer, 32, who
launched it in July.

Now Virgin bosses have asked Airbus to build a stronger table.

At first, German engineers responsible for the jet's interior were
baffled by the problem.

The table is designed to take the weight of a mum and baby.

One Airbus worker said: "We couldn't work it out. Then the penny
dropped. It didn't occur to the Germans that this might happen. It
caused great amusement."

The firm say the cost of strengthening the tables will be about £200.

A Virgin spokeswoman said: "Those determined to join the Mile High
Club will do so despite the lack of comforts.

"We don't mind couples having a good time but this is not something
that we would encourage because of air regulations."

The new Airbus is the world's longest airliner, with teasing slogan
"Mine is bigger than yours". Virgin is using it on flights to the Far
East and the US.
