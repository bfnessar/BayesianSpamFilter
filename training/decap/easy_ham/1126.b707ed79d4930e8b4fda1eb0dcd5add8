Maybe you could find more info or tips on the ALSA page for your card?
Also, you could try "alsactl store", editing /etc/asound.state" by hand
(for me it contains data similar to what I can control with "alsamixer")
then run "alsactl restore" and see if you're able to change what you want
that way.
