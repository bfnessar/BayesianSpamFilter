Doesn't seem *likely*, as it appeared in about 900 of about 14,000 spams.
It could be specific to one of his bait addresses, though -- don't know.  A
nice thing about a statistical inferencer is that you really don't have to
know why a thing works, just whether it works <wink>.

I'm going to blow it off -- it's just another instance of being pointlessly
baffled by a mixed corpus half of which I don't know enough about.
