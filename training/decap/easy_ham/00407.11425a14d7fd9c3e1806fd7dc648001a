Actually, you use both.

No, even best supercapacitors are a long way to go from reasonably good 
electrochemical energy sources. But you can recharge and discharge them 
very quickly, and they take lots more of cycles than the best battery. 
Ideal for absorbing the braking energy and turn them into smoking tires 
few moments or minutes afterwards.

I don't see any reason why EVs shouldn't dominate dragster runs. The
traction is the limiting factor, not motor power. You can basically put
the motors into wheelhubs mounted on a composite frame, and dump juice
into them until they melt, which will be some 100 sec downstream. Plenty
of time to smoke anything.

Of course, it doesn't roar, and spew smokage, so it won't happen.
