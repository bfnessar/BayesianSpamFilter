Brian sez: Vocera Communications has developed what is essentially a Star Trek: 
TNG-style lapel communicator device that uses WiFi to transmit voice across 
networks. 

    The Vocera Communications System consists of Vocera Server Software, 
    residing on a customer premise server, and Vocera Communications Badges, 
    which operate over a wireless LAN (802.11b). The badge - which weighs less 
    than 2 ounces - includes a microphone and speaker, LCD readout to display 
    text messages, and an 802.11b wireless radio. It can be clipped to a shirt 
    pocket or collar, or worn on a lanyard.
