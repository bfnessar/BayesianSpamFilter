Subject: Re: [Razor-users] spamassassin+razor2

No as a answer to this FAQ, would the recommended answer be to 

a) chmod 755 /usr/bin/procmail

or 

b) add DROPPRIVS=yes to /etc/procmailrc

or 

c) all of the above


I ask because I just did B, and my procmail is still:
-rwsr-sr-x    1 root     mail        67988 Jul 24 15:43 /usr/bin/procmail
But things seem to be working, so far..
