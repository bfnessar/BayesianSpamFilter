Hi,

I think you need to give us a little more detailed information.

As in freezes, reboots?  Do you get any errors?

Did you disable it in the BIOS or in windows?

1. What laptop is it?  What is the Processor and how much RAM does it have?

2. You cannot simply boot off the cdrom?  It must be quite an old laptop
