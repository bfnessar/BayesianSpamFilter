Subject: Re: Economist: Internet models, viral spread, social diseases

The structure of the Internet has never
been about where the ditches and ruts
are dug although the world needs
ditch diggers too.

It's a simple inductive concept:
You are you and see the world as such,
You plus 1 degree of separation is a new you.

All this stuff about scale-free Internets, viruses,
sex, and money is silly.  Scale-free statistically
indistinguishable models really means Internet-Scale
as rediscovered by social networks people.

I tend to prefer the Harvard Business Review
to the Economist as they tend to spend less
time writing about who's sleeping with whom and
come up with real statistical models.
