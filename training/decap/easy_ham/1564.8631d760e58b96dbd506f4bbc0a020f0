No, they only have to prove that they send several million
emails to 'potential clients' to get their money.  I don't think
they even care much about bounces.  They're con-artists, why
should they care about proving they actually reached people?

Most of the time the bounce goes to some poor soul who has
nothing to do with the spammer.
