We all learned that sooner or later, right? When I got down to that myself
is when I started redhat.aldil.org, now known as freshrpms.net ;-)

Strange.
Anyway, although I'd easily recommend upgrading 7.x to 7.3 using apt, I
wouldn't for 7.x to 8.0 as they are C++ binary incompatible... and apt is
entirely written in C++ and dynamically linked :-/

Still, that doesn't explain a core dump :-(
