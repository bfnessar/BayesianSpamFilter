Subject: [ILUG] Retrieving read mail from webmail.eircom.net via POP ?

Is there a way to get my read email downloaded off webmail.eircom.net.

I've been reading the emails using the web based interface. But I've
reached my quota limit. There doesn't seem to be any way to get the
emails off the server. I can connect to the account using POP, but that
only retrieves unread emails. There's also no way to mark emails as
unread from the html interface.

Is there a way I can use fetchmail perhaps to get it to pull down all
the emails and remove them off the server.

It's been years since I've used fetchmail, I don't recall be able to do
this.

Any other suggestions welcome. There's a few hundred email so I don't
fancy going through each one forwarding it to another account.

Glen
