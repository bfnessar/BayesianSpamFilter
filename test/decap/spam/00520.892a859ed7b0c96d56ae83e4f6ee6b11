O'Connor quickly moved his cursor down the left side of the web
page. Then, showing a flash of his silky skills, he cut across to
the right hand side and clicked on Top Ten Special Offers. He zipped
past the Irish Chicken Breast Fillets at 25% off, nipped round the
HB Selections ice cream also at 25% off and went on with the goal
firmly in sight:

  - Budweiser '24 pack 500ml cans'. Was E49.20. Now E42.15. SAVE E7.05*

  - Guinness '24 pack 500ml cans'. Was E50.16. Now E42.33. SAVE E7.83*


With one of his trademark clicks of the mouse he sent his cost-price
cases of beer straight into the back of his online basket.  1 - 0 to
Ireland. From there O'Connor was unstoppable and went on to make it
an unforgettable afternoon as he tucked away another four goals:

  - Pringles Large Tubes 200g. Was E2.05 each. Now buy 2 for E3.00*

  - Hula Hoops Minis Tub 140g. Was E2.42. Now buy one get 2nd half price*
