My tests train on about 7,000 msgs, and a binary pickle of the database is
approaching 10 million bytes.  I haven't done anything to try to reduce its
size, and know of some specific problem areas (for example, doing character
5-grams of "long words" containing high-bit characters generates a lot of
database entries, and I suspect they're approximately worthless).  OTOH,
adding in more headers will increase the size.  So let's call it 10 meg
<wink>.
