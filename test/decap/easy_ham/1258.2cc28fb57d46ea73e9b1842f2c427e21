Subject: Patch to enable/disable log

While I was playing with the past issues, it annoyed me that there was
no easy way to make the log stop growing (I don't mean to truncate it,
I mean to just freeze it for a while).

The following patch adds a new button to the log window, which allows
the log to be switched on/off (the button says "Disable" when the
log is enabled, and the button disables it, and "Enable" when the log
is frozen, and the button enables it again).
