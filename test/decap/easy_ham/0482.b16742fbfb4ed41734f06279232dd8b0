Get Sexier, Keep Husbands, Mayor Tells Wives
Wed Sep 4, 9:14 AM ET

MISSAGLIA, Italy (Reuters) - Husband's eyes wandering? Make yourself sexier.
At least that's the solution proposed by an Italian mayor -- and a woman
mayor at that.

Wives in the northern town of Missaglia had complained to mayor Marta
Casiraghi about a young woman who sunbathed topless on her terrace.

They complained that the men in the town of some 7,000 people were spending
too much time ogling, so they asked Casiraghi to order the woman to put her
clothes back on.

But the mayor, far from sympathizing, told the wives to get sexy if they
wanted to keep their men. "The girl was very pretty and was soaking up some
sun. Topless sunbathing is largely tolerated and widespread nowadays.
There's nothing we can do," Casiraghi told Il Nuovo, a web-based newspaper.

"Instead, I'd advise the wives to play their rival at her own game -- make
themselves more beautiful."
