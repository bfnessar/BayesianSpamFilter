Rob "Pringles Can" Flickenger and others at the O'Reilly OS X con have tracked 
down the cause of the annoying flakiness in the wireless network here -- every 
20 or 30 seconds, you start getting "connection refused" messages from your 
browser and other net-utilities. 

It turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other 
"promiscuous" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same 
time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your 
segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a "rejected" message. 

So today, Rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around 
and tell people running Etherpeg to _turn off the firewall_ (and vice-versa). 
Ah, fickle networking, you are such a stern mistress! Link[2] Don't do the 
brown WiFi, the brown WiFi is BAD (_Thanks, Rob!_)
