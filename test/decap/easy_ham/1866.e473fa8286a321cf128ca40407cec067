The latest proposal to drive the Taliban and Al Qaeda out of the
Mountains of Afghanistan is to send in the ASF (Alabama Special
Forces) Billy Bob, Bubba, Boo, Scooter, Cooter and Junior are being
sent in with the following information about the Taliban:

1. There is no limit.
2. The season opened last weekend.
3. They taste just like chicken.
4. They hate beer, pickup trucks, country music, and Jesus.
5. Some are queer.
6. They don't like barbecue.

And most importantly...

7. They were responsible for Dale Earnhardt's death.

We estimate it should be over in just about two days.
