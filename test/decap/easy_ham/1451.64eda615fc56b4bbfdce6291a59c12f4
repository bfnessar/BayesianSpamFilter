Uh... the reason is simple. Habeas runs something called the 
"Habeas Infringers List", and if you use their trademark without 
their permission, you'll end up on it.  Then, when you send spam 
with the misappropriated header, users of SA (2.40 supports 
this) will tag your mail as spam, rather than let it through. 
This may be done independantly of your IP address, so be 
prepared to constantly change domain names, and move your 
servers as fast as you send spam.

Also, that little haiku is a copyrighted work, so not only CAN 
Habeas sue, they MUST sue to protect their copyright. And since 
it's a trademark as well, that's a double-whammy. Habeas has 
some pretty high-powered legal people, who will gladly go to 
town on violators.

The whole point here is to give them the legal leverage they 
need to put spammers out of business, and not only block mail 
from them, but allow through the things that really AREN'T spam.
