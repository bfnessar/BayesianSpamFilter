Subject: Re: boycotting yahoo

Well I don't think China could force Yahoo! to give up info.  So if they 
are so willing to give it, why wouldn't they be willing to give info to 
some silly group who may one day decide to get a hair up their ass about 
the practice of BDSMers? (not to mention folks who don't even practice, 
but who are just interested in information) What about folks who are 
interested in talking about software security issues?  Didja read about 
the guy in China who got 11 years for downloading and printing out pro-democracy 
info?

I'm confused about what you're confused about.
