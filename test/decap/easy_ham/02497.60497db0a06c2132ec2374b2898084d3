Subject: Re: [ILUG] Linux Install

Hi Gianni,

A very good resource for this is:
http://linux-laptop.net/
or:
http://www.mobilix.org/

They have walk through guides for an umber of latops, highlighting what
to look out for.

Have a look there, and let us know if you succeed.

Cheers,

Phil Trickett
