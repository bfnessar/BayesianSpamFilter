and it looks like PPP for USD 33k is only
about USD 50k*, at least in Big Macs:

Australia	 A$3.00 USD 1.62	-35%
US		  $2.49 USD 2.49
Switzerland	SFr6.30 USD 3.81	+53%

Interestingly enough, although housing in
Perth seems cheap, housing in Switzerland
doesn't seem to be as expensive as the Big
Macs would imply.

can convert urban CA equity into free and
clear Oz ownership.
