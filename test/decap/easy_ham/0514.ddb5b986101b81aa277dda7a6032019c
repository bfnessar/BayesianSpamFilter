"Chastity" technologies were doomed from the start, and I'll add chemical 
ones to the trash heap.  (Yeah, Cindy, these are decorative toys for the 
subculture, but....)  

Generally,someone is attempting to preserve a relationship with this 
nonsense, when quite plainly the the relationship is in a state where 
preserving it is of little value.  Hardware is of no real use save for 
playing the power-struggle game.   I don't want to see the future of this.
"Invisible Fence" for your mate.   "Must wear" location transponders and 
endocrine monitors.   More movies like "Minority Report."

It seems so automatic for people to reach for coercive solutions.   So 
surprizing given the low absolute effectiveness of coercion in the absense 
of overwhelming force advantage.
