Japanese toilet technology has developed creeping featuritis. New Tokyo toities 
sport speech-recognition, air-conditioning, and body-chemistry monitors: 

    Japan's toilet wars started in February, when Matsushita engineers here 
    unveiled a toilet seat equipped with electrodes that send a mild electric 
    charge through the user's buttocks, yielding a digital measurement of 
    body-fat ratio. 

    Unimpressed, engineers from a rival company, Inax, counterattacked in April 
    with a toilet that glows in the dark and whirs up its lid after an infrared 
    sensor detects a human being. When in use, the toilet plays any of six 
    soundtracks, including chirping birds, rushing water, tinkling wind chimes, 
    or the strumming of a traditional Japanese harp.
