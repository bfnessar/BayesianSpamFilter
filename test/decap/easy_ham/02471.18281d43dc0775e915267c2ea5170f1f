Subject: Re: [SAtalk] Blocking ?

This is possible, however using SA as a block criteria is not recommended. 
SA does have a very realistic chance of mis-marking mail so using it as an 
autodelete function is at best extraordinarily foolish.


However, here's what the procmail rule will look like (dug up from an old 
post to this list by Steve Thomas):
--------------------------------------------------------------------
in your .procmailrc file:

:0
* x-spam-status: yes
/dev/null


DO NOT DO THIS! You'll throw out a LOT of legitimate messages over time.

Instead, do what the docs suggest and put them into a separate mail folder:

:0:
* x-spam-status: yes
$MAILDIR/spam
--------------------------------------------------------------------
