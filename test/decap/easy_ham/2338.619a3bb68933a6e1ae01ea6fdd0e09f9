Here's a brief interview with me.  

    *Interviewer:* If the Boing Boing zine and blog were TV characters, who'd 
    they be, and how'd they get on? 

    *Mark:* The zine would be Jethro Bodine of "The Beverly Hillbillies" -- 
    curious, neophilic, xenophilic, gleeful, and eager to adopt any new theory 
    or conspiracy as the absolute truth. The Blog would be Sherman from 
    "Peabody's Improbable History" -- a traveler of time and space in search of 
    beauty, truth, and the outre. I think Jethro bOING bOING and Sherman Boing 
    Boing would be great pals. Jethro would invite Sherman's dog, Mr. Peabody, 
    to go raccoon hunting with him, and Sherman would send Jethro 40 years into 
    the future to hang out at the Playboy Mansion.
