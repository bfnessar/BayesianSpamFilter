Indeedy - I had never even heard of firebird until we started a new job
last week with a client who uses it.  So we popped it onto a box

also.  Supports all the db goodies, transactions, stored procedures,
triggers.

IBM's db2 is another cheaper alternative to Oracle.  Free single
developer license downloadable from their website.
